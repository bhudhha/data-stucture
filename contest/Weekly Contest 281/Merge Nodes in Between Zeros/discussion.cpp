/*We want to form a lexicographically largest string using the characters in a given string.
But we have to make sure that a letter is not repeated more than the given limit in a row (i.e consecutively).

So we use a priorityqueue to pop the element which has the highest priority. If it's count is less than the repeatLimit, we directly add to the ans.

But if it's count is greater than the repeatLimit, we just add the repeatLimit amount of the present character and we pop out the next priority character and add a single letter to the ans.
This makes that a letter is not repeated more than limit in a row and lexicographically largest is maintained. After adding to the ans, if we have extra characters left out, we just push back into priority_queue for the next use.

Here if we are not able to pop, the next priority character, we just return the ans so as we cannot add more than repeatedLimit charecters in a row.*/
